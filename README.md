# Artillery-X1-to-Voron-Switchwire-conversion
This is an in progress full conversion of the Artillery Sidewinder X1 to the Voron Switchwire. My goal is to make it as complete a conversion as possible and to fully enclose the printer. I have use multiple parts from the Ender 3 conversion as they both share 2020 extrusion. Even so I have had to redesign or create the parts that won't work with the sidewinder. 

The printing volume should remain like stock at 300 x 300 x 400mm

# Info
I am trying to keep as much of the original printer as possible currently I have saved:

The frame (Although I did replace the top extrusion and the gantry).

The heatbed assemble.

XYZ motors.


Im hoping to save:

The cables 

Fans

I think that the board could be saved, but im not much of a coder and kept it simple by doing standard Swichwire Electronics
